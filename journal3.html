      <h3>Community values in #computer-science <a href="https://discord.com/invite/homework"></a></h3>

      <p>
        Since the last two modules, I decided to
        narrow my focus mainly to the #computer-science channel. 
        I have participated continued to participate as mainly an observer 
        but also answered and asked a few questions. At the moment of updating this entry, 
        I don't have any special status or role in the entire server (or broader community since
        you can think of the server as like the main website 
        where all the communities are accessible).
        I noticed that while the community is extremely active
        in terms of the response time to questions and 
        the amount of users in it, there are tensions between what 
        different people may value. 
        
        From all my cumulative experience in this space, most people asking
        questions are seeking assistance to complete a school assignment.
        Those asking questions for personal projects are of a small minority.
        The likelihood of someone posting a question
        out of personal curiosity seems even smaller to me. 

        However, most people answering questions seem to be intrinsically
        motivated to help others gain a better understanding of the subect content. 

        At times when a channel is "slowing down" or there are no 
        questions that have yet to be answered, 
        some people will voluntarily post their experience, 
        offering help to anyone. See the below post by a user offering their expertise:

        <blockquote>
          Hi, I'm a Certified  IT expert and have the following skill 
          set if you need any help please let me know.
            Windows
            Linux
            Networking
            System Administration
            Cloud Engineering
            Cloud Computing
            AWS/AZURE/GCP
            Office 365
            VOIP
            Technical Writing
            Security
            Ethical Hacking
            Programming
        </blockquote>
        
        I have actually asked questions out of curiosity, though not in the #computer-science
        channel. I once asked about recommendations for philosophy literature
        that is application-based and was almost instantly met 
        with enthusiastic recommendations of books (one being Practical Ethics, a great read!).
      </p>

      <p>
        While I think the different values people hold in the community 
        do and can lead to conflict (which I will touch on in the next section), 
        I think this is good in the grand scheme of things. 

        In threads of back-and-forth discourse, people asking questions are 
        often prompted into thinking more deeply about a question. 
        
        While someone may start off with a question of 
         <blockquote>
          Why does my code not work [insert code snippet]?
         </blockquote>
        They often are guided to see the gaps in their understanding of 
        the concepts being tested in the question and/or given
        useful advice about how to go about solving a similar problem 
        independently in the future.

      <h3> Communication spaces: channels vs dms </h3>
      <p>
        Another source of conflict I saw was with the issue of too many 
        people asking for help directly in dms (or direct messages). 
        While it is not uncommon for some conversations to move to dm 
        (I have seen this occur in channels like #english where people
        do not want to release their writing publicly), 
        staff in the community generally discourage this practice. 

        This practice is discouraged not because private conversations are inherently
        bad for learning, but because they run the danger of
        people paying others to do their assignments--which is a huge violation
        of Homework Help's community guidelines. 

        In fact, I saw a thread where a staff member directly clarified this (I would
        copy the content here, but I unfortunately cannot find the link at this moment), 
        calling a question asker to please request assistance in the public channels. 

        I also think this is an efficiency issue because if someone were to ask their
        question(s) publicly they are more likely to get multiple perspectives from 
        multiple people instead of just relying on help from the first person who 
        responds to their request. 
      </p>

      <h3>My recommendations for clearer communication guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        I think Homework Help should make it clearer that 
        communication should be conducted in channels. Perhaps it could 
        set up an automated bot, like I defined in the last journal entry, which
        will notify posters if they mention the word dm or direct message. 

        On the topic of bots, I am also curious about the implication of 
        using chatGPT on such a community. I am curious what aspects are present
        in the interactions in #computer-science and Homework Help as a whole
        that cannot be replaced by chatGPT answering homework questions. 

      </p>
