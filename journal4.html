      <h3>Spaces to interact in #computer-science <a href="https://discord.com/invite/homework"></a></h3>
      <p>
        In previous journal entries, I observed that the online community for #computer-science
        has multiple places to interact though main interactions happen in 
        variations of Q&A format via the #computer-science channel. 
        I would now like to expand on that observation. I found that
        there are multiple places for interactions to happen such as:
        the main #computer-science channel, channels for general 
        chatter, channels for events for the whole broader community (not limited to computer science)
        and related channels such as #uni-computer-science which is university specific computer science. 
      </p>

      <hr class="featurette-divider">
      <h3>My recommendations for spaces of interaction</h3>
      <p>
        When I joined this online community earlier there were
        all the same spaces of interactions as above with the exception of 
        the university specific channels. 
        I recommend that the broader community has more guidelines for
        navigating all these spaces in general since even after being in
        this communtiy for so long I still find it confusing to know whether a question
        or topic should be put in the university specific channel or the general #computer-science channel. 
        This observation could also be because my research and interests are in the technical side
        of human computer interaction, but I also think the community could do a better
        job of communicating norms for knowledge sharing in these different spaces. 
        The only space where it seems clear that people should answer and ask questions
        are the subject specific channels such as #computer-science. In the general channels, I am always unsure
        what the norms for knowledge sharing are.
