      <h3>Q&A vs Tutors: Tensions in #computer-science in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/homework">Homework Help</a></h3>

      <p>
        For the past two weeks (modules 5 & 6), I decided to
        narrow my focus mainly to the #computer-science channel. 
        I have participated mainly as an observer but also 
        answered and asked a few questions. I don't have any special
        status or role in the entire server (or broader community since
        you can think of the server as like the main website 
        where all the communities are accessible).
        I noticed that while the community is extremely active
        in terms of the response time to questions and 
        the amount of users in it, there is a unique
        tension between the question-answer forum interpretation
        of the community and the online-tutor interpretation of it. 

        To futher elaborate, a user posted the following:
        <blockquote>
          I love the classic
          1. Ask for help
          2. Not provide a question
          3. Someone responds immediately
          4. Person never messages again
        </blockquote>
        The above post was met with responding support, showing that this is 
        a common occurrence on these types of platforms. 

        This example also interestingly shows that while the initial
        relationship between the asker and answerer is tentative and fragile 
        with little accountability on mostly the asker's side, the answerer is
        often able to form relationships with others in the community just by
        responding to offer their help. 

        This was also surprising to me since I would intuitively expect
        that is there more of a shortage of answerers than askers, not for
        it to be the other way around.

      <h3>Implications for Moderation</h3>
      <p>
        To maintain the community, there are a series of "bots" that
        roam around each of the channels. Bots are essentially pieces of software
        written to perform small tasks in a specific environment. In this case, 
        for example, there is a "rewardbot" that will automatically react to
        messages that show thanks for helpers with cheerful emojis. There are also Bots
        that automatically warn users for posting inappropriate content. 
        I have yet to seen egregiously inappropriate content, and I assume that 
        is the doing of the bots and the human volunteer moderators. 

        Another interesting aspect of maintenance is that of "spam" or multiple posts. 
        Some users will often just message "help" or send the same question
        to multiple channels. In this case, I usually see these messages taken down 
        after multiple people respond the tell the user this behavior violates 
        community norms. I find this particularly interesting because while this isn't 
        spam in the case of advertisement, it seems like these users need to be better
        educated on the community norms. So, I'm curious about what happens to their accounts 
        after they do this. Are they kicked out of the server or just given a stern warning? 
        If they are kicked out, will they eventually come back with another account?

      <h3>My experience asking and answering questions</h3>
      <p>
        I also dabbled a bit in asking and answering questions. For this, I actually
        branched out of #computer-science because I was personally curious about a topic 
        in #philosophy. I did answer a few #computer-science and #english questions though.
        My experience was largely positive. When I asked questions people responded quickly
        and were very kind and helpful. I was redirected to credible resources like books
        written by experts. When I thanked people, they also either replied and/or used emojis
        to show that they recognized my thanks. Personally, I find that strengthens the relationship
        between asker and answerer since it doesn't feel like a "one-and-done" situation then. 
        When answering questions I always received thank you messages as well.
