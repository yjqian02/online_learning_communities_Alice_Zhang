      <h3>How community is maintained within <a href="https://discord.com/invite/homework">Homework Help</a></h3>

      <p>
        The community I am exploring is the #computer-science channel within the 
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/homework">Homework Help</a> Discord server. This server
        is very popular among students with 20k members active usually and around 165k members total.
        Members here usually interact asynchronously via text and at most hop on voice/video calls. 
        There are assigned roles for people who answer questions frequently, but everything is done on a volunteer basis and 
        moderators regularly enforce academic integrity and other community guidelines. 
        Other than the subject content, a lot of what people learn how to do in this server is formulate a 
        question to ask asynchronously using text + images + other (like code). Since this community is so 
        large, I decided to focus on the computer science learning community within the Homework Help community. 
        To do this, I observed the following channels (which are similar to Slack channels:
        <ol>
            <li>#computer-science </li>
            <li>#c-cpp</li>
            <li>#java-jvm</li>
            <li>#python</li>
            <li>#js-ts</li>
            <li>#cs-other-languages</li>
            <li>#web-development</li>
            <li>#computer-engineering</li>
            <li>#latex</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        The main platform used for this community is <a href="https://Discord.com">Discord</a> which is a collaboration
        platform originally developed to allow people who play video games to connect. However, over the past few years Discord
        has been adapted for educational uses--particularly in computer science given the lower barrier to entry since many
        computer science students are technically literate and for online classes during the pandemic. In fact, many people refer to 
        Slack as the "professional" version of Discord. As a researcher, I am very interested in this phenomenon and also have personal
        experience using Discord professionally while previously working in a startup, as a student, and as a teaching instructor.
        I would be happy to share resources if anyone is interested in learning more about the adaptive uses of Discord in non-video gaming
        settings (educational, recreational, etc.).

      <h3>Implications for Moderation</h3>
      <p>
        The community operates like a living-forum. If we think of traditional forms like question and answer bulletin 
        boards, the Homework Help server is built on those basic components ... plus a whole lot more. 
        Members mainly interact in these specific channels, but there is also a <b>#general</b> channel for casual conversation with
        everyone and a <b>#introductions</b> channel for new joiners to introduce themselves. 
        There are also channels for <b>#tips</b> and <b>#rules</b> to guide new members in learning about the structure and 
        expectations of the community. 
        Members of the community can participate by asking questions, answering questions, simply reading what others 
        ask, and reacting with emojis or gifs. 
        Members can select roles by their subject area of interest or expertise. There are also
        roles assigned such as Contact Staff and Valued Contributor. Staff are volunteer moderators who regularly
        screen the channels for harmful messages or spam. In addition to Valued Contributors, there are many more roles 
        (so many that I'll probably expand on this in a later journal entry) which award people who have put in varying levels 
        of time and effort into helping answer others questions and participating in discussions in the channels.

      <h3>My experience asking and answering questions</h3>
      <p>
        Above, I talked about how community is sustained by the moderators and the people who keep asking questions. 
        Community is created by the relationships formed among question askers and answerers. Due to the size of the server, 
        it can be difficult to form 1-1 relationships, however, relationships seem to form over the span of a few days or a few
        interactions when a person posts and question and another person responds via a thread (like Twitter threads for those unfamiliar). 
        The asker will usually follow-up and express their gratitude. This gratitude and follow-up is key since that's when 
        the relationship transitions from ask-answer to more of a back-and-forth conversation. Of course, I'm simplifying many of the interactions
        here since most conversations involve 2+ parties and many streams of back and forth that can happen all in one day or over the span of several days.
